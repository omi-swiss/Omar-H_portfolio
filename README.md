## Project 1: [Customer Propensity Model for an E-Commerce Company](https://github.com/omi-swiss/Customer-Propensity-Model)

This project is for an emerging e-commerce startup that offers a wide range of products, from daily essentials like dairy and vegetables to high-end electronics and home appliances. Despite a growing number of visitors exploring their platform, only a small fraction actually makes a purchase.

**Goal**: To boost sales without depleting their limited marketing budget, the company plans to send targeted discounts or coupons to users who are more likely to make a purchase. As a trusted partner, we were tasked with building a propensity model to predict the likelihood of individual users buying a product. This predictive model will enable the company to identify and target users with the highest purchase probabilities, ensuring a more efficient and cost-effective marketing campaign.

- Data provided by projectpro.io.
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of the dataset to ensure data quality and performed feature engineering for a more robust model.
- The model uses logistic regression and an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer propensity modeling.
- Optimized the logistic regression model for improved performance.

## Project 2: [Avocado Price Prediction](https://github.com/omi-swiss/ML-Price-Prediction)

This project focused on forecasting the prices of avocados in the US. We explored multiple machine learning approaches to determine the optimal model for predicting avocado prices.

**Goal**: Predict the price of avocados in the future.

- Data provided by projectpro.io.
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain insights into avocado pricing trends, seasonal patterns, and regional variations.
- Performed feature engineering to create relevant features that can enhance the performance of our price prediction models.
- Utilized two time series models to predict prices: ARIMA and SARIMA.

## Project 3: [Retail Price Optimization](https://github.com/omi-swiss/ML-Price-Optimization)

This project focused on a retail company looking to optimize the prices of their products. We analyzed restaurant sales data and applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and price elasticity concepts to set ideal prices.

**Goal**: Improve profitability by optimizing prices.

- Data provided by projectpro.io.
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of the dataset to understand purchasing trends of products and gain insights into price sensitivities using linear regression.
- Used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate the parameters of the linear regression model.
- Further optimized the analysis by incorporating price elasticity to understand how changes in price affect the quantity demanded of a product or service.
